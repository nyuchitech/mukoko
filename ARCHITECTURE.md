## 1. Executive Summary

Mukoko is a Digital Twin Social Ecosystem for Africa and the global African diaspora, delivered as a WeChat-style super app on Android, iOS, and Huawei devices. It is the flagship product of The Bundu Family, built by Nyuchi Africa.

The platform consists of 15 interconnected mini-apps — including Campfire, Pulse, Mukoko News, Bytes, Circles, Nhimbe, Novels, BushTrade, Mukoko Lingo, and more — all powered by "Your Honey," a privacy-first personalization engine that works FOR users, not against them. Your Honey runs on-device AI, meaning user behavior data never leaves the device. This is the core product: personalization that empowers rather than manipulates.

The application uses a hybrid architecture: a Flutter native shell provides the core platform services (authentication, wallet, Shamwari AI, notifications, device APIs), while the 15 ecosystem mini-apps run as optimized WebView mini-apps, enabling rapid development and independent deployment. Each app can also operate as a standalone PWA.

This architecture is adapted for African market realities: mixed device quality, high data costs, intermittent connectivity, and mobile money as the primary payment rail.

- **Target Markets:** Zimbabwe (primary), SADC region, global African diaspora
- **Platforms:** Android (API 24+), iOS (15+), HarmonyOS (Huawei AppGallery)
- **Framework:** Flutter native shell + WebView mini-apps (WeChat model)
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (existing), MongoDB Atlas, D1, KV, Durable Objects
- **AI:** Shamwari AI companion + Nuchi Honey personalization engine (honey.nyuchi.com)
- **Payments:** EcoCash, InnBucks, bank integrations + MUKOKO token economy
- **Identity:** Mukoko ID with Soulbound Identity Token (MIT) on Polygon PoS

## 2. The Bundu Family

Mukoko exists within a unified brand ecosystem rooted in Shona language and Ubuntu philosophy. Understanding this hierarchy is essential to the architecture because it determines how products relate, how branding flows, and how the user journey works.

### 2.1 Brand Hierarchy

| Layer        | Name              | Role                           | Mineral    | Hex (Light) | Hex (Dark) |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Container    | Bundu             | The Family — Parent Entity     | Terracotta | `#8B4513`   | `#D4A574`  |
| Philosophy   | Ubuntu            | Guidelines & Guardrails        | Gold       | `#5D4037`   | `#FFD740`  |
| Action       | Nyuchi (Bee)      | Collective Effort, Pollination | Gold       | `#5D4037`   | `#FFD740`  |
| Structure    | Mukoko (Hive)     | Community Gathering Space      | Tanzanite  | `#4B0082`   | `#B388FF`  |
| Intelligence | Shamwari (Friend) | AI That Lives Inside the Hive  | Malachite  | `#004D40`   | `#64FFDA`  |

### 2.2 The Symbiotic Metaphor

> _"The bee needs the hive. The hive needs the bees. Neither exists meaningfully without the other."_

Bees (Nyuchi) fly out into the Bundu (wilderness) to collect, pollinate, and build. They return to the Mukoko (hive) to store knowledge, collaborate, and rest. Inside the Mukoko lives Shamwari — the collective wisdom, the helpful AI intelligence. The cycle continues: gather → store → share → grow.

This mirrors the Ubuntu principle: "Munhu munhu muvanhu" — A person is a person through other persons.

### 2.3 The User Journey in the Bundu Family

1. **ENTER THE BUNDU** — Discover the ecosystem (marketing, word-of-mouth)
2. **JOIN THE MUKOKO** — Create Mukoko ID (single sign-on), welcome ceremony (onboarding)
3. **MEET SHAMWARI** — AI companion introduces features, personalized guidance begins
4. **BECOME NYUCHI** — Start contributing (learning, sharing, creating), pollinate across platforms
5. **SERVE THE HIVE** — Help others in community, store knowledge for next generation
6. **EMBODY UBUNTU** — "I am because we are" realized, individual success = community success

### 2.4 Product Relationships

Mukoko is the flagship Digital Twin Social Ecosystem. Other Nyuchi products are **separate** but use Mukoko ID for authentication:

- **Nyuchi Learning** — Education platform (separate product, uses Mukoko ID)
- **Zimbabwe Travel** — Travel/tourism platform (separate product, uses Mukoko ID)
- **Harare Metro** — Merges INTO Clips (no longer separate; becomes part of Mukoko)

## 3. Your Honey — The Core Product

> _"Your Honey. Your Identity. Your Sovereignty."_

Your Honey is the single most important component of Mukoko. It is a personalization engine that learns user preferences on-device and surfaces relevant content across all 15 mini-apps. Unlike exploitative algorithms that optimize for engagement (platform profit), Your Honey optimizes for enrichment (user growth).

### 3.1 How Your Honey Works

1. **You Choose Interests Explicitly** — 32 categories with granular keywords (e.g., "African tech startups" within Technology)
2. **Your Digital Twin Learns On-Device** — As you engage across Mukoko News, Pulse, Circles, Novels, Nhimbe, your preferences evolve. All processing stays on YOUR device, never sent to servers.
3. **Content Surfaces Across All Components** — Mukoko News shows news you care about, Pulse surfaces creators you'll love, Circles suggests matching communities, Novels recommends stories, Nhimbe highlights relevant gatherings.
4. **Preferences Evolve As You Grow** — Your Digital Twin captures personality evolution. Interests deepen, shift, and new passions emerge naturally.
5. **Privacy Preserved Always** — On-device AI means no data sent to servers, no surveillance, no selling preferences, no manipulation.

### 3.2 The 32 Interest Categories

Users select from 32 categories during onboarding and can adjust at any time. Each category has granular sub-keywords. Examples:

- Technology (AI, startups, programming, African tech, gadgets)
- Music (Afrobeats, Chimurenga, Amapiano, Gospel, Hip-Hop, Sungura)
- Business (Entrepreneurship, Finance, Investing, SMEs, Agriculture)
- Sports (Football, Cricket, Rugby, Athletics, Boxing)
- Culture (Shona traditions, Ndebele heritage, Pan-African identity, Diaspora)
- Food (Zimbabwean cuisine, Cooking, Restaurants, Street food)
- Politics (Zimbabwe, SADC, AU, Global affairs)
- Health (Fitness, Mental health, Traditional medicine, Healthcare)
- Education (STEM, Languages, Vocational training, Scholarships)
- Entertainment (Movies, Series, Comedy, Theatre, Gaming)
- _...and 22 more categories_

### 3.3 Nuchi Honey Technical Architecture

Nuchi Honey is the backend personalization service that powers Your Honey. It runs on completely isolated infrastructure, separate from the main Cloudflare Workers deployment, for maximum privacy and security.

| Component     | Detail                                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoint      | `honey.nyuchi.com`                                                          |
| Access        | Secret-based authentication via Cloudflare Tunnel (zero public exposure)    |
| Runtime       | Docker containerized, FastAPI-based service                                 |
| Monitoring    | Prometheus metrics collection, comprehensive health checks                  |
| Resilience    | Netflix-inspired: circuit breakers, retry logic, bulkhead isolation         |
| Privacy Model | Federated learning — improves platform without exposing individual behavior |

### 3.4 On-Device AI Architecture

The on-device component runs as a lightweight ML model embedded in the Flutter shell. It processes user interactions locally, builds the Digital Twin profile, and communicates with Nuchi Honey only to receive updated model weights (federated learning), never raw user data.

- **Model format:** TensorFlow Lite (Android/Huawei) + Core ML (iOS)
- **Size target:** < 5MB model, < 10MB total on-device AI footprint
- **Battery budget:** < 2% additional drain from background learning
- **Sync pattern:** Model weight updates via delta sync, not full model download
- **Local storage:** Digital Twin profile stored encrypted in app sandbox (SQLite)

## 4. The 15 Mini-Apps

Mukoko consists of 15 interconnected mini-apps, all sharing one Digital Twin, one Your Honey engine, one reputation system, and one token economy. Each app is implemented as a WebView mini-app loaded inside the Flutter shell.

| App           | Domain                 | Purpose                                      | Type           |

### 4.1 Mukoko News — Informed Communities

Mukoko News is the evolution of Harare Metro. It provides context-rich news from trusted African and global sources, filtered by Your Honey to surface topics the user actually cares about. News should inform, not manipulate. Context over clickbait.

- Migrates from existing `mukoko-news-backend` Cloudflare Worker
- RSS aggregation from 17+ Zimbabwean sources (Herald, NewsDay, Chronicle, ZBC, Techzim, The Standard, ZimLive, Business Weekly, etc.)
- AI-powered categorization into 10+ content categories
- Your Honey personalizes the feed based on Digital Twin interests
- Threaded comments, bookmarks, reading history (MongoDB Atlas)

### 4.2 Pulse — Your Personalized Feed

Pulse is the super app's aggregated feed — a monorepo-native feature that pulls content from ALL ecosystem apps into a single, personalized stream. It exists only within the super app, powered by **Your Honey**.

- Aggregates content from Mukoko News, Circles, Novels, Nhimbe, and creator content
- Personalized by **Your Honey** (on-device learning + Mukoko ID cloud profile)
- Combines TikTok-style vertical scrolling with Instagram-style discovery
- MUKOKO token rewards for quality content creation
- **Not to be confused with Bytes** — Bytes is the TikTok-style scrolling feature in the `mukoko-news` standalone app only

### 4.3 Circles — Interest Communities

Interest-based communities. Your Honey suggests Circles matching explicit interests and recommends discussions the user would find valuable. Community forms around shared interests, not algorithmic manipulation.

- Circle creation and moderation tools
- Discussion threads with rich media
- Circle reputation system (moderators earn tokens)
- Cross-pollination: Mukoko News articles can be discussed in relevant Circles
- Leverages existing Durable Objects (ChatRoom, UserSession) for real-time features

### 4.4 Novels — Author Platform

Web novel platform supporting African authors. Authors keep 80%+ of revenue. Your Honey recommends stories in genres the user loves. African stories deserve global audiences.

- Chapter-by-chapter publishing
- Reader engagement (likes, comments, bookmarks)
- Author dashboard with analytics
- MUKOKO token payments for premium chapters
- Genre categorization aligned with Your Honey interest categories

### 4.5 Nhimbe — Community Gatherings

Cultural celebrations, meetups, and community events. Evolves from the existing Nhimbe Events platform. Digital connection should enhance physical community, not replace it. Integrates with Mukoko Wallet for ticket purchasing.

- Migrates from existing `mukoko-nhimbe-api` Cloudflare Worker
- Event discovery powered by Your Honey (location + interests)
- Ticket purchasing via Mukoko Wallet (EcoCash, InnBucks, MUKOKO tokens)
- Event organizer tools (create, manage, promote)
- Post-event community: attendees can form Circles

### 4.6 Campfire — Platform Anchor

Campfire is the messaging + payments core — the WeChat-style anchor that keeps users in the ecosystem. Messaging, voice notes, group chats, and integrated payments (EcoCash, InnBucks, MUKOKO tokens) in one place.

### 4.7 Additional Mini-Apps

Beyond the core apps, Mukoko includes:

- **BushTrade** — Peer-to-peer marketplace for buying/selling within the community
- **Mukoko Lingo** — Language learning focused on African languages
- **Weather** — Local weather forecasts for Zimbabwean cities
- **Transport** — Kombi/taxi routes, transit info, and ride booking
- **Bytes** — TikTok-style short-form video scrolling (shares backend with Mukoko News)

## 5. Shamwari AI — The Intelligence Layer

> _"I serve, I do not control."_

Shamwari (Shona for "friend") is the AI companion that lives inside the Mukoko hive. It is not a separate app but an omnipresent intelligence woven into every part of the ecosystem, guiding users, providing recommendations, and bridging human connection with technology.

### 5.1 Shamwari's Role

- **Onboarding guide** — Introduces new users to the ecosystem, helps configure interests
- **Cross-app intelligence** — Surfaces connections between Clips articles, Pulse creators, Connect discussions, Novels, and Events
- **Conversational assistant** — Answers questions, helps navigate, provides context
- **Content summarization** — Summarizes long articles, provides TLDR for busy users
- **Language support** — Multilingual assistance including Shona and Ndebele

### 5.2 Shamwari's Code (Guidelines)

- **Companionship** — Be present without being intrusive
- **Guidance** — Suggest, don't command
- **Trust** — Earn trust through consistent helpfulness
- **Humility** — Know your limitations
- **Partnership** — Work alongside humans, not above them

### 5.3 Technical Integration

Shamwari runs as a service accessible through the MukokoBridge API. Mini-apps can invoke Shamwari for contextual assistance. The Flutter shell provides a persistent Shamwari chat interface accessible from any screen via a floating action button.

- **Brand color:** Malachite (`#004D40` light / `#64FFDA` dark)
- **Backend:** Dedicated Cloudflare Worker + AI model inference
- **Context:** Receives anonymized context from Your Honey to provide relevant assistance
- **Personality:** Warm, knowledgeable, culturally aware, never condescending

---

## 6. Mukoko ID & Digital Twin

Mukoko ID is the honeycomb that holds the honey. It is the enabling infrastructure that makes Your Honey possible — invisible to users enjoying the sweetness, but essential to the ecosystem. Great infrastructure disappears.

### 6.1 What Mukoko ID Provides

- **ONE** login across all six apps (seamless, no friction)
- **ONE** Digital Twin that learns evolving personality
- **ONE** reputation system that builds as users participate anywhere
- **ONE** wallet collecting MUKOKO tokens from all activities
- **ONE** Your Honey engine that improves across everything

### 6.2 Digital Twin — Soulbound Identity Token (MIT)

Each user's Digital Twin is anchored by a **MUKOKO Identity Token (MIT)** — a soulbound, non-transferable ERC-721 token on the Polygon PoS blockchain. This is not a collectible NFT — it is a mathematical representation of a person's temporal identity within the ecosystem.

- **Soulbound:** Cannot be sold, traded, or transferred. The `transferFrom` function is overridden to revert unconditionally.
- **Birth-date anchored:** Minted with the user's verified date of birth. This date becomes the mathematical anchor for value calculation.
- **Three-pool membership:** Every MIT simultaneously belongs to a Year Pool (birth year), Month Pool (birth month), and Day Pool (birth day-of-month).
- **Monotonically increasing value:** Token value grows at exactly one second per second. There is no crash scenario in the protocol.
- **One per human:** Enforced at the contract level — one MIT per verified identity.
- **Deletable:** Users can burn their token and delete all associated data (full data sovereignty).

#### The Three-Pool Value System

The MIT's value is the weighted composite of three temporal pools:

```
V(token, t) = 0.60 × Mean(Year Pool) + 0.30 × Mean(Month Pool) + 0.10 × Mean(Day Pool)
```

| Pool       | Weight | Contains                                  | Property                              |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Year Pool  | 60%    | Everyone born in the same calendar year   | Largest, most stable, greatest anchor |
| Month Pool | 30%    | Everyone born in the same month, any year | Bridges generations                   |
| Day Pool   | 10%    | Everyone born on the same day, any month  | Most personal, most distinctive       |

Pool means are computed in O(1) via running aggregates — no iteration over members, regardless of pool size. This is essential for continental scale (1B+ users).

#### Leap Day Correction

People born on 29 February belong to a pool that accumulates members only once every four years. A normalisation factor `L = 4` scales their day pool contribution to be equivalent to a full-representation pool. Calendar equity is non-negotiable.

#### Smart Contracts (Polygon PoS, Solidity ^0.8.20)

| Contract              | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MukokoPoolRegistry`  | Running aggregates for Year, Month, Day pools. O(1) lookups.  |
| `MukokoIdentityToken` | Soulbound ERC-721. Minting, pool assignment, transfer revert. |
| `MukokoValueOracle`   | Composite value formula with governance-adjustable weights.   |
| `MukokoExchangeToken` | ERC-20 MXT with floor price mechanism. Elastic supply.        |
| `EmissionController`  | Governs all MXT minting. Annual ceiling. Baseline emission.   |

**Chain:** Polygon PoS (low gas, EVM-compatible, existing African exchange liquidity).
**Framework:** OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.
**KYC:** Africa Talks API (primary, SMS OTP verification), Stytch (secondary, web/desktop users).

### 6.3 The Memory File

The **Memory File** is the central personalization artifact for each user. It is co-created by two systems:

```
Nyuchi Honey (on-device)          Mukoko ID (cloud)
┌─────────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Learns preferences   │ ──sync──▶│ Stores Memory File   │
│ privately on phone   │ summaries│ in user's account    │
│ Raw data stays local │          │ Editable by user     │
└─────────────────────┘          └──────────┬──────────┘
                                            │ reads
                              ┌─────────────┼──────────────┐
                              ▼             ▼              ▼
                          Shamwari AI    Pulse feed    All app
                          (companion)   (aggregated)   personalization
```

- **Honey** processes interactions on-device, syncs only summarized data (never raw events) to Mukoko ID
- **Mukoko ID** stores the Memory File securely in the cloud
- **The user can edit or delete** their Memory File at any time — full data sovereignty
- **Shamwari AI**, Pulse, and all app personalization read the Memory File

### 6.4 Existing Infrastructure

Mukoko ID already has production and staging Cloudflare Workers deployed (`mukoko-id-api`, `mukoko-id-api-staging`). The Flutter shell integrates with this existing infrastructure via Stytch authentication, adding biometric unlock, secure token storage, and the Digital Twin minting flow.

### 7.3 MukokoBridge JavaScript API

Injected into every mini-app WebView. Provides typed access to native platform services.

```javascript
window.MukokoBridge = {
  auth: {
    getUser()           // Current user + Digital Twin profile
    getToken()          // JWT for API calls
    onAuthChange(cb)    // Subscribe to auth state
  },
  honey: {
    getInterests()      // User's 32-category interest map
    trackInteraction({ type, contentId, duration })
    getSuggestions(context)  // Ask Your Honey for recommendations
  },
  shamwari: {
    ask(question)       // Invoke Shamwari AI
    summarize(content)  // Content summarization
    translate(text, lang)
  },
  wallet: {
    getBalance()        // Wallet balance (fiat + MUKOKO tokens)
    requestPayment({ amount, currency, description })
    transferTokens({ to, amount })
    onPaymentResult(cb)
  },
  device: {
    getLocation()       // GPS coordinates
    openCamera()        // Returns image data
    scanQR()            // QR code scanner
    share(data)         // Native share sheet
    haptic(type)        // Haptic feedback
  },
  nav: {
    openMiniApp(id, params)  // Launch another mini-app
    goBack()                 // Navigate back
    setTitle(text)           // Update nav bar title
  },
  storage: {
    get(key) / set(key, value) / remove(key)
  },
  reputation: {
    getScore()          // Cross-platform reputation
    getTokenBalance()   // MUKOKO token balance
  }
}
```

### 7.4 Mini-App Framework

Each of the six ecosystem apps is a lightweight web application loaded inside the Flutter shell's WebView.

- **UI Framework:** Preact (3KB gzipped — not React's 40KB)
- **Design System:** `@mukoko/ui` — shared Nyuchi Brand v6 components
- **Bridge SDK:** `@mukoko/bridge` — typed TypeScript wrapper around MukokoBridge
- **Build:** Vite, output < 150KB gzipped per mini-app
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare R2 (static assets) + Workers (API)
- **Caching:** Service Worker + Flutter WebView cache (offline-capable)
- **Standalone:** Each mini-app also works as PWA at its subdomain

## 8. Backend Architecture

The backend leverages existing Cloudflare Workers infrastructure already deployed and running. The mobile app targets the same API endpoints, with a new API gateway worker for unified routing.

## 9. MUKOKO Token Economy

### 9.1 Two-Token Architecture

The system operates with two tokens that have distinct roles but work together as a single economic system.

**MUKOKO Identity Token (MIT)** — soulbound, non-transferable, anchored to verified birth date. Used for governance staking and as the value anchor for the exchange token. The right analogy is ancestral land under Ubuntu customary law — it represents your permanent stake in the community.

**MUKOKO Exchange Token (MXT)** — standard transferable ERC-20 used for all transactions across the platform. Its floor price is derived from the MIT pool system. This is the currency people spend. Think of it as the money circulating on the land — backed by something real, spendable freely, and always guaranteed a minimum value by the protocol.

**The core economic loop:** More users join → more MITs are minted → pool means grow as the community ages → MXT floor rises → the platform becomes more valuable to everyone already on it. Growth benefits all existing members. This is Ubuntu expressed as token economics.

### 9.2 Elastic Supply Model

There is **no hard supply cap** on MXT. This is the single most important design decision in the token economics.

A fixed supply is the right model for digital gold — a scarce store of value. It is the wrong model for a transaction currency designed to serve a growing continental economy. Africa's GDP is ~$3 trillion today, projected to reach $29 trillion by 2050. At continental scale, a fixed supply combined with a burn mechanism would strangle the platform's own success.

Three parameters govern the MXT supply, all stored in the EmissionController contract and adjustable only through Tier 1 constitutional governance votes:

| Parameter               | Default      | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline emission rate  | 10,000 MXT   | New MXT minted per verified user. Ties supply growth to user growth.  |
| Annual emission ceiling | 15% per year | Hard cap on annual supply growth. Cannot double in less than 5 years. |
| Burn rate               | 30% of fees  | Percentage of platform fees permanently removed from supply.          |

### 9.3 Token Allocation

Initial minted supply: **3 billion MXT**. Governance protection for the founding team comes from Reserved Powers (legal), not token dominance — freeing the allocation to reflect where value actually comes from.

| Allocation                     | %   | Amount      | Governance                            |
| ------------------------------ | --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Ecosystem Reserve              | 30% | 900,000,000 | Tier 2 vote required for each release |
| Community Treasury             | 20% | 600,000,000 | MIT holders via conviction staking    |
| Founding Team                  | 25% | 750,000,000 | 4yr vest / 1yr cliff                  |
| Operations Reserve             | 10% | 300,000,000 | Operational expenditure               |
| Investors & Strategic Partners | 10% | 300,000,000 | Economic rights only, no governance   |
| Advisors                       | 5%  | 150,000,000 | 2yr vest / 3 month cliff              |

**50% goes to the community from day one.** Investors get economic participation — not governance rights.

### 9.4 Conviction Staking Governance

Governance uses conviction staking, not coin-voting. The effective weight formula:

```
Effective Weight = √(MXT staked) × Ubuntu Multiplier × Regional Multiplier
```

- **Square root (quadratic voting):** Doubling your stake only increases weight by ~41%. A community of 1,000 people staking 100 MXT each outweighs one person staking 100,000 MXT.
- **Ubuntu Multiplier (1.0×–2.0×):** Rewards sustained community engagement, derived from on-platform Ubuntu Score.
- **Regional Multiplier:** Platform-wide votes = 1.0×. Regional votes = 2.0× for affected region. Country-level = 3.0× for affected country.

**Four Governance Tiers:**

| Tier | Scope          | Quorum | Examples                                           |
| ---- | -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Constitutional | 66%    | Protocol changes, emission parameters, Charter     |
| 2    | Strategic      | 40%    | Regional expansion, reserve releases, major policy |
| 3    | Operational    | 20%    | Feature priorities, content moderation, pricing    |
| 4    | Community      | 10%    | Circle governance, local content, regional ops     |

**Founder's Reserved Powers:** Embedded in the Mukoko Foundation's Mauritius constitutional documents as legal rights — not token rights. Protects: Ubuntu purpose, African sovereignty mandate, platform control, core token protocol. The community governs operations. The founder protects the soul.

### 9.5 Earning and Spending MXT

**Earning:**

- **Clips** — Quality comments, sharing, community journalism
- **Pulse** — Creating content, trending contributions, curation
- **Connect** — Circle moderation, helpful discussions, community building
- **Novels** — Publishing stories, reader engagement, editorial contributions
- **Events** — Organizing events, community gathering, cultural celebration

**Spending:**

- Event tickets, novel chapters, marketplace transactions
- Peer-to-peer payments and remittances across African borders
- Premium features across all apps
- Enterprise API access (B2B demand)

### 9.6 Creator Economics

Creators keep **80%+** of revenue (vs. 30-50% on mainstream platforms):

- Novel authors: **85%** of chapter revenue
- Pulse creators: **80%** of tipping revenue
- Event organizers: **90%** of ticket revenue
- Circle moderators: reputation + token bonuses

Creator rewards are distributed in MXT from the Ecosystem Reserve — creating income denominated in a currency with a rising floor value.

### 9.7 Platform Revenue Flows

For each MXT fee collected: **30% burned** (permanent supply reduction), **40% Community Treasury** (governance distribution), **30% Ecosystem Reserve** (creator rewards, developer grants).

### 9.8 Local Fiat Integration

The wallet displays all values in the user's preferred local currency. Off-ramp partnerships with mobile money providers enable conversion without crypto exchange accounts:

- **M-Pesa** — East Africa
- **MTN MoMo** — West and Central Africa
- **Airtel Money** — East and Central Africa
- **EcoCash** — Zimbabwe (primary launch market)
- **InnBucks** — Zimbabwe (growing market)

## 11. Data Efficiency & Offline Strategy

Data costs are a primary concern in Zimbabwe. The architecture minimizes data consumption at every level.

### 11.1 Optimization Strategies

- Mini-app bundles downloaded once, cached locally (50-150KB gzipped per app)
- Shared design system loaded once across all mini-apps (not duplicated)
- Images via Cloudflare Images: automatic WebP/AVIF, responsive sizing
- API responses: gzip compression, pagination, delta sync (only changes since last timestamp)
- User-configurable data saver mode: reduces image quality, disables auto-play, limits prefetch
- Your Honey model weights: delta sync, not full model download

### 11.2 Offline Architecture

SQLite (`sqflite`) serves as local database with sync queue pattern. When offline, all writes queue locally with timestamps. When connectivity returns, the sync engine replays against the API with conflict resolution (last-write-wins for content, manual resolution for payments). News, weather, and events are cached with TTLs. The app remains fully browsable offline with stale data indicated in UI.

### 11.3 Data Budget Targets

| Action                          | Data Cost       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| App install (Flutter shell)     | < 25MB          |
| Each mini-app first load        | < 150KB gzipped |
| News feed refresh (20 articles) | < 50KB          |
| Your Honey model sync           | < 500KB (delta) |
| Image (article thumbnail)       | < 30KB (WebP)   |

## 13. Design System: Nyuchi Brand v6

All UI uses the Five African Minerals palette. Mukoko Platform: Tanzanite primary, Cobalt secondary, Gold accent.

### Color System

| Role                 | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Usage                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Primary (Tanzanite)  | `#4B0082`  | `#B388FF` | CTAs, active states, primary nav      |
| Secondary (Cobalt)   | `#0047AB`  | `#00B0FF` | Links, info states, secondary actions |
| Accent (Gold)        | `#5D4037`  | `#FFD740` | Rewards, wallet, honey, highlights    |
| Shamwari (Malachite) | `#004D40`  | `#64FFDA` | AI companion, success states          |
| Bundu (Terracotta)   | `#8B4513`  | `#D4A574` | Community, Ubuntu, parent brand       |

### Typography

- **Display:** Noto Serif (elegant, cultural weight)
- **Body:** Plus Jakarta Sans (clean, modern, excellent readability)
- **Code:** JetBrains Mono (developer-facing content)

### Design Tokens

- Button radius: 12px
- Card radius: 16px
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum
- Five African Minerals strip: 4px vertical left edge (Tanzanite → Cobalt → Gold → Malachite → Terracotta, hidden < 480px)
- Wordmarks: always lowercase (`mukoko`, `nyuchi`, `shamwari`, `bundu`)
- Contrast ratios: WCAG AAA (7:1+) — non-negotiable
- Mode adaptation: all colors adapt between light and dark automatically

### Brand Separation Rules

- **Travel Brand:** NO purple/tanzanite (nature-forward aesthetic)
- **Education Brand:** Uses slate dark theme variant (`#0F172A` base, `#1E293B` surface)
- **Mukoko Platform:** Tanzanite primary, Cobalt secondary, Gold accent
- **Shamwari AI:** Malachite primary, Cobalt secondary, Gold accent

## 16. Mukoko Foundation & Legal Structure

### 16.1 Dual-Entity Architecture

The platform operates through two legally independent entities with distinct roles:

**Mukoko Foundation** — Mauritius, registered under the Foundations Act 2012

- Non-profit custodian of the protocol, token economics, and Ubuntu charter
- Holds the VASP licence under the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021 (VAITOS)
- Controls the PoolRegistry, EmissionController, and IdentityToken smart contracts
- Governed by a Council elected by MIT holders via conviction staking
- Cannot be acquired, merged, or dissolved without a Tier 1 constitutional vote (66% quorum)
- Jurisdiction chosen for: common-law legal system, FATF-compliant crypto regulation, tax treaty network, and proximity to African markets

**Nyuchi Africa (Pvt) Ltd** — Zimbabwe, registered under the Companies and Other Business Entities Act

- For-profit operating company that builds and operates the Mukoko platform
- Employs the engineering, design, and operations teams
- Holds commercial agreements with payment providers (EcoCash, InnBucks, M-Pesa)
- Revenue from platform fees, enterprise API access, and premium features
- Licensed by the Foundation to operate the platform under a revocable service agreement

### 16.2 Founder's Reserved Powers

The founder's governance protection is embedded in the Foundation's constitutional documents as **legal rights** — not token rights. This ensures the platform's soul cannot be voted away by token accumulation.

Reserved Powers (exercisable only by the founder or their appointed successor):

| Power                           | Scope                                                                           | Rationale                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ubuntu Veto**                 | Block any proposal that fails the Ubuntu Test                                   | Prevents platform capture by extractive interests |
| **African Sovereignty Mandate** | Require majority-African Council composition                                    | Ensures the platform remains African-led          |
| **Core Protocol Lock**          | Veto changes to MIT soulbound property, birth-date anchoring, three-pool system | Protects the foundational identity architecture   |
| **Emergency Pause**             | Temporarily halt token operations during security incidents                     | Circuit breaker for existential threats           |

Reserved Powers cannot be used to: allocate tokens, direct treasury spending, override operational governance (Tier 3-4), or benefit the founder financially. They exist solely to protect purpose.

### 16.3 Regulatory Compliance

| Jurisdiction | Regulation                      | Status                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mauritius    | VAITOS Act 2021 (VASP licence)  | Application in preparation                            |
| Mauritius    | Foundations Act 2012            | Foundation registered                                 |
| Zimbabwe     | Exchange Control Regulations    | Compliant — MXT treated as utility token              |
| EU           | MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) | Monitoring — Mauritius VASP provides equivalence path |
| FATF         | Travel Rule                     | Built into wallet-to-wallet transfers above threshold |

### 16.4 Intellectual Property

- Mukoko platform IP owned by Nyuchi Africa, licensed to the Foundation
- Open-source components released under MIT License
- Brand assets (mukoko, nyuchi, shamwari, bundu wordmarks) trademarked by Nyuchi Africa
- Smart contract source code published and verified on Polygonscan

## 17. Security & Privacy

- **Transport:** All API communication HTTPS with certificate pinning
- **Token storage:** JWT tokens in platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore), never in WebView localStorage
- **Mini-app sandboxing:** Scoped storage per app, no cross-app data access without MukokoBridge
- **Your Honey:** On-device only, federated learning for model updates, no raw data leaves device
- **Wallet:** Biometric auth required for transactions above threshold
- **Digital Twin NFT:** User-controlled, deletable (burn), exportable
- **Nuchi Honey service:** Isolated infrastructure, Cloudflare Tunnel, secret-based auth
- **Mini-app permissions:** Apps declare required capabilities in manifest, user approves
- **PCI DSS:** No card data stored on device, tokenization only
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Role-based access control on all collections
- **Secrets management:** All API keys and tokens in environment variables, never in source code
- **Admin access:** `bryan@nyuchi.com` is super_admin with full RBAC system

## 18. The Ubuntu Test

Before any feature, product, or decision launches, it must pass the Ubuntu Test:

1. **Does this strengthen community?** (Not just engagement)
2. **Does this respect human dignity?** (Not just compliance)
3. **Does this serve the collective good?** (Not just revenue)
4. **Would we explain this proudly to our elders?** (Not just legally)
5. **Does this align with "I am because we are"?** (Not just "I win")

If the answer to any is "no," reconsider.
